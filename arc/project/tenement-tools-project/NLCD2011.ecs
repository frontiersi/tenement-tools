NLCD 2011 provides - for the first time - the capability to assess wall-to-wall, spatially explicit, national land cover changes and trends across the United States from 2001 to 2011. As with two previous NLCD land cover products NLCD 2011 keeps the same 16-class land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across the United States at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2011 is based primarily on a decision-tree classification of circa 2011 Landsat satellite data.","classDefs":[{"classVal":10,"alias":"10","name":"Water","color":"#5475A8","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":20,"alias":"20","name":"Developed","color":"#E8D1D1","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":30,"alias":"30","name":"Barren","color":"#D2CDC0","description":"","subclasses":[]},{"classVal":40,"alias":"","name":"Forest","color":"#85C77E","description":"","subclasses":[{"classVal":41,"alias":"41","name":"Deciduous Forest","color":"#85C77E","description":"Deciduous Forest - areas dominated by trees generally greater than 5 meters tall, and greater than 20% of total vegetation cover.
